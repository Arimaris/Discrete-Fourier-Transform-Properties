# Discrete Fourier Transform Properties

The main objective of this project is to create an environment
to demonstrate the properties of the discrete Fourier transform.

The discrete Fourier transform table was taken from _Digital 
Signal Processing: A Computer Based Approach_ by Sanjit Mitra.
This project aims to visually show each of the table's 
properties as a way to facilitate their understanding by 
students.


In order to execute this project, you will need access to the
matplotlib library, which is included inside the Anaconda 
Python distribution.

#Execution
1. Download the Anaconda distribution for Python 3.6 from
this website: https://www.anaconda.com/download/.
2. Install a Python IDE, such as JetBrains Pycharm Community
Edition.
3. Download the latest version of the project from this 
repository.
4. Create a new project with all of the project's files 
and execute ``the file named _Properties.py_.
5. Follow the instructions given by the menu.
